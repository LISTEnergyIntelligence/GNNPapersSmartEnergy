## Papers

A curated list of papers with links to their respective publications:

- **[Optimal Power Flow Using Graph Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11194)** - Owerko, D., Gama, F., Ribeiro, A., 2020. This paper explores the application of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for solving the Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problem, a critical aspect of power system operation and planning.
  
- **[Power Flow Analysis via Typed Graph Neural Networks](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S014206152300048X)** - Lopez-Garcia, T.B., Dom√≠nguez-Navarro, J.A., 2023. This work introduces the use of Typed Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) for power flow analysis, addressing the need for models capable of handling the diverse components and relationships present in power grids.

## Datasets

Links to public datasets related to smart energy and GNN applications:

- **[PowerGraph: A Power Grid Benchmark Dataset for Graph Neural Networks](https://github.com/PowerGraph)**  
  *Description*: PowerGraph is a collection of datasets designed for benchmarking GNNs in power system applications. It includes datasets tailored for power flow analysis, optimal power flow, and cascading failure analysis. These datasets cover a range of scales, topologies, and operational characteristics (IEEE24, IEEE39, IEEE118, and a UK transmission system) to ensure comprehensive evaluation.

## Code

Links to open-source implementations of GNNs applied to Smart Energy:

- **[PowerGraph-Datasets Repository](https://github.com/PowerGraph/PowerGraph-Datasets)**  
  *Description*: This repository provides the code for obtaining the PowerGraph dataset in the InMemoryDataset format and for benchmarking GNN and explainability methods.

- **[SafePowerGraph Repository](https://github.com/SafePowerGraph/SafePowerGraph)**  
  *Description*: This repository offers a simulator-agnostic, safety-oriented framework and benchmark for GNNs in power system operations. It includes a dataset zoo and model zoo, enabling the evaluation of GNN performance under scenarios such as energy price variations and power line outages. Self-supervised learning and graph attention architectures are key to enhancing GNN robustness in power systems.
